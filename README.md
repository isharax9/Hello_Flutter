# My First Flutter App

Welcome to my first Flutter app repository! This project is an exciting journey into the world of mobile app development using Google's Flutter framework. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this repository is a great place to explore the fundamentals of Flutter.

## About Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Here are some key points to get you started:

- **Cross-Platform:** Flutter allows you to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and even web and desktop.
- **Dart Language:** Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is easy to learn and comes with a rich set of libraries.
- **Widget-Based:** The user interface in Flutter is constructed using widgets, which are reusable components that describe the layout and behavior of your app.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Flutter, here's how to get started with this project:

1. **Installation:** Make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. You can find installation instructions in the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

3. **Run the App:** Use `flutter run` from the project directory to launch the app in your emulator or connected device.

## Project Structure

In this repository, you'll find the following important directories and files:

- **`lib/`**: This is where the Dart code for your app resides.
- **`pubspec.yaml`**: This file contains project dependencies and metadata.
- **`assets/`**: Place your app's assets like images, fonts, and more here.

## What I learned from this project 
### Understanding Rows and Columns in Flutter

In Flutter, the layout of your app's user interface is often organized using rows and columns. These are essential components for creating structured and responsive layouts. Here's a brief introduction to how rows and columns work in Flutter:

### Rows

A `Row` widget arranges its children in a horizontal sequence. It's often used to place widgets side by side. Some key points about rows include:

- Children are positioned horizontally.
- You can use the `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` properties to control the alignment of children.
- Rows automatically wrap to the next line when the screen width is exceeded.

Example of a Row widget:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Item 1'),
    Text('Item 2'),
  ],
)
```
